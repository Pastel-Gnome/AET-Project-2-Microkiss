# AET Project 2 Microkiss
 Team Members: Victoria Porter, Amelia Lewey, & John Yoon

 In this project, we wanted to recreate the iconic scene in Princess and
 the Frog with the very simple options that the servos provided. We could
 go from 0 to 180 degrees. In the end, we decided to go with a 180 degree
 turn, a 9- degree rotation, and a 180 degree that would knock another
 piece of our project into place.

Switch one is an 'amulet' made of airdry clay. There is copper tape inside
the switch, which completes a circuit when it is closed. When it is broken,
the villain is knocked off the table 'into hell'.

Switch two is a red button. When you press it, the circuit is completed,
and a servo turns 90 degrees with a wooden dowl connected to it. This
'flagpoles' the voodoo puppet out of the ground.

Switch three is another button. When the circuit is completed, the servo
inside the wall does a 180 to reveal the screaming face of the villain.

All three microbits send radio signals from to each other to activate their
servos. Radio signals are sent when the switches are used.
